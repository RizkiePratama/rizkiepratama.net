<p>Hi! I'm a Software Engineer from Bandung, Indonesia, currently working in the world of video engineering at <a href="https://vidio.com/">Vidio.com</a>. My journey into tech started surprisingly early, back in 6th grade, and I taught myself programming just two years later. I've been building things ever sinceâ€”from simple HTML pages to my very own FPS game!</p>
<p>My passion really took off in college when I got into C/C++ and the fascinating world of low-level and bare-metal programming. It's the kind of stuff that truly excites me. Today, I primarily use Ruby and GoLang for my work and side projects, but I'm no stranger to other languages like Python, Javascript, and C# when a different tool is needed for the job.</p>
<p>I believe in always learning and challenging myself with new tech. When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new ideas or tinkering with a side project. I'm always open to connecting with fellow engineers and creators!</p>
