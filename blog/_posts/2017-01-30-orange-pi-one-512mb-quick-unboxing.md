As i mention earlier, The Orange Pi One just arrived this yesterday'in a nice condition. And i was thinking it's probably a good idea to post a quick unboxing here. This is my first ever development board i ever have, so it's kinda exciting to actualy put my hands on it. Not that i actually planning to buy this, but thanks to Perdana Hadi aka'*ceroberoz *and certain'people at the IoT Telegram groups that makes me hooked up to this board.'If you're in Indonesia and wan't to buy any IEM, Adruino or Mini PC kit, i highly recommend you to buy it from his (*ceroberoz*) [Kere Keren Store](https://www.bukalapak.com/kerekeren)'at BukaLapak.

Alright, before we jump to the unboxing let's find out technical stuff about this'Orange Pi One.

Considering this is my first ever board and because i'm not yet play around with it i can't really give any though of it. Might be updated soon once i'm done playing around with it for a while later this night.
